## L4 Microkernels
- A concept is tolerated inside the (micro) kernel only if moving it outside the kernel would prevent the implementation of the system's required functionality
- basic mechanisms required like:
  - address spaces (page tables, memory protection, virtual memory)
  - threads and scheduling
  - inter process communication (IPC)
  - file system support (VFS)
  - any additional ones???
